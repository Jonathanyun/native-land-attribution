Project Log File 

01/22/2024:
Cloned the native lands git repo into personal repository from KathrynPanger and reviewed files. Following 
URLs are helpful for starting the project and may contain redundant information already found in the repo. 
-- Repo for the .csv files
https://github.com/KathrynPanger/native-land-attribution

-- Site for the Project 
https://github.com/hackforla/data-science/issues/45

Goals are debug the problems that KathrynPanger found within the code and then also create more visualizations
that aid in the initial goal of the project.
